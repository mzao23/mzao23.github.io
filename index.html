                <p>Model United Nations is a simulation program designed to build strong and lasting
                relationships between the United Nations and participants from around the world.
                This United Nations program encourages participants to take concrete action in support of UN
                values and sustainable development goals. To this end, the leaders of the program develop   
                guides and organize workshops - called miniMUNs - that teach young people to make their   
                activities more authentic, by attending UN-style conferences and meetings to share    
                first-hand knowledge of the United Nations.</p>

            <h1>What is MUN ?</h1>
            <p>Model United Nations is a United Nations simulation designed to train participants in
            international negotiations. These simulations aim to promote human rights, communication
            and international relations skills, as well as the basics of diplomacy. As part of the UN 
            simulations, students take on the role of ambassadors or foreign ministers, participating in
            simulations of international sections of the UN. Participants are asked to research countries,
	    debates and international issues in an attempt to find solutions to global problems.</p>

            <h1>The MUN process...</h1>
            <p>MUNs take place over the space of a few days. Participants gather in one place - often a
            school - and are divided into several committees, each dealing with different issues and 
            representing a different country or organization, called a "delegation" (e.g. Mexican 
            delegation). The final aim is to sign a resolution at the end of the debates, after presenting
            their resolutions and/or political texts. The debates are set up to encourage the development 
	    of oral argumentation skills, as well as the ability to convince an audience, while respecting
	    the speaking rules of the UN stimulations.</p>

            <h1>THE PROCEDURE</h1>
            <p>During the simulations, participants must use various means of communication and
            negotiations to represent the policies of the countrie they are representing. These
            simulations therefore involve public speeches as well as the analysis of
            other international positions, negotiations and conflict resolution. They also involve the
            drafting of technical papers (working papers: draft resolutions).</p>
